1. Start the Django shell
	- Run the shell from within the app folder. api/
	- So cd into api/ then call python ..\manage.py shell

Inside the Django Shell, run the following:

2. from api.models import Course, Day, Class

3. from api.loader import load_data

4. Declare a list with the file names.
	- Convention is a list like this:
		files = ['mon.xlsx', 'tue.xlsx', 'wed.xlsx', 'thu.xlsx', 'fri.xlsx']

	Ensure all files are placed in api/parserfiles

5. Create all the Day objects. Monday - Friday in that order.
	- Example:  m = Day(name="Monday")
							m.save()

							reapeat for the other days.

5. Type this in the shell:
			load_data(files)

6. That's all. Unless there are unexpected breaks.

It is important to note that all files in api/parserfiles smust be sanitized manually. Unexpected spaces in
course names can lead to confusing duplicates, and can ultimately affect the integrity of the DB.

    json_response = json.dumps(queryset)
    return render(request, 'api/index.html', json_response)
